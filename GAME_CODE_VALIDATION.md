# Game Code Validation Enhancement

## Overview
This enhancement ensures that game codes become invalid when the host exits the game from the lobby, preventing players from joining games that have been terminated.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Join Game Validation (`components/join-game-dialog.tsx`)
- **Before**: Only checked if game status was "waiting"
- **After**: Added comprehensive validation:
  - Checks if game exists
  - Checks if game is finished (`finished: true` or `status: "finished"`)
  - Checks if game is in waiting status
  - Provides specific error messages for different scenarios

### 2. Enhanced Wait Page Validation (`app/wait/[gameCode]/WaitContent.tsx`)
- **Before**: Only checked if game exists
- **After**: Added validation to check if game is finished before allowing players to wait

### 3. Enhanced Play Page Validation (`app/play/[gameCode]/PlayContent.tsx`)
- **Before**: Only checked if game exists
- **After**: Added validation to check if game is finished before allowing players to play

### 4. Improved Host Exit Function (`app/host/[gameCode]/HostContent.tsx`)
- **Before**: Set `status: "ended"` (invalid status)
- **After**: Set `status: "finished"` (valid status) when host exits
- Also updated `endQuiz()` and auto-finish functions to use correct status

### 5. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20250727204115_add_finished_column.sql`)
- Added missing columns to games table if they don't exist:
  - `finished` (BOOLEAN)
  - `is_started` (BOOLEAN)
  - `quiz_start_time` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `countdown_start_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `time_limit` (INTEGER)
  - `question_count` (INTEGER)
- Added indexes for better performance

## How It Works

### Game Lifecycle
1. **Created**: `status: "waiting"`, `finished: false`, `is_started: false`
2. **Started**: `status: "playing"`, `finished: false`, `is_started: true`
3. **Finished**: `status: "finished"`, `finished: true`, `is_started: false`

### Validation Flow
When a player tries to join a game:

1. **Join Dialog**: 
   - Checks if game exists
   - Checks if game is finished → Shows "This game has ended and is no longer available"
   - Checks if game is in waiting status → Shows "Game not found or already started"

2. **Wait Page**:
   - Checks if game is finished → Redirects to home with error message

3. **Play Page**:
   - Checks if game is finished → Redirects to home with error message

### Host Actions
- **Exit Game**: Sets `finished: true`, `status: "finished"`, `is_started: false`
- **End Quiz**: Sets `finished: true`, `status: "finished"`, `is_started: false`
- **Auto Finish**: Sets `finished: true`, `status: "finished"`, `is_started: false`

## Error Messages
- **Game not found**: When game code doesn't exist
- **This game has ended and is no longer available**: When game is finished
- **Game not found or already started**: When game is not in waiting status

## Benefits
1. **Security**: Prevents players from joining terminated games
2. **User Experience**: Clear error messages explain why joining failed
3. **Data Integrity**: Consistent status management across all game states
4. **Performance**: Added database indexes for faster queries

## Testing
To test this enhancement:

1. Create a new game as host
2. Share the game code with a player
3. Have the player try to join (should work)
4. As host, click "Exit Game" from the lobby
5. Have the player try to join again (should show "This game has ended and is no longer available")
6. Try to access the wait or play page directly with the old game code (should redirect to home)
